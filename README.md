🚀 Experiment

A collaborative Java playground where ideas come alive, code evolves through contributions, and AI (ChatGPT) plays the role of a virtual teammate.

This repository is not just about building software—it’s about learning, experimenting, and co-creating with people and AI.

✨ What’s Inside

🧪 Experiments in Java – small projects, prototypes, and algorithm explorations.

🤝 Collaborative Development – multiple contributors shaping and refining ideas.

🤖 AI-Assisted Coding – ChatGPT is heavily used for:

Generating starter code & refactoring

Explaining tricky concepts

Writing docs & READMEs

📖 Open & Shareable – licensed under AGPL-3.0 to ensure contributions remain free and open.

⚡ Getting Started
Prerequisites

Java JDK 8+

(Optional) Maven
 or Gradle
 if experiments use build tools

Git for version control

Installation
git clone https://github.com/Asmit159/Experiment.git
cd Experiment


Each folder contains a self-contained experiment. Navigate inside, build, and run.
